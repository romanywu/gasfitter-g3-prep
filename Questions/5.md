    b) It can be used for other functions than electrical.
    c) It can provide power when needed.
    Answer: a
    万用表（multimeter）的用途是测量电压（voltage）、电流（current）和电阻（resistance）。

74. When using a meter to measure voltage, how must the voltmeter be connected into the circuit?
    a) In series with the circuit.
    b) Does not matter as long as it is connected in the circuit.
    c) In parallel with the circuit.
    Answer: c
    测量电压时，电压表（voltmeter）必须与电路并联（in parallel）连接。

75. When using a meter to measure current, how must the ammeter be connected into the circuit?
    a) In parallel with the circuit.
    b) In series with the circuit.
    c) Does not matter as long as it is connected in the circuit.
    Answer: b
    测量电流时，电流表（ammeter）必须与电路串联（in series）连接。

76. Should an ohmmeter be connected into a live circuit?
    a) Yes
    b) No
    Answer: b
    不应将欧姆表（ohmmeter）连接到带电电路（live circuit）中。

77. What should be done if the value of voltage or current to be measured is unknown?
    a) Start with the highest range and work down.
    b) Start with the lowest range and work up.
    c) Start in the middle of the range.
    Answer: a
    如果待测电压或电流值未知，应从最高量程（highest range）开始，然后向下调整。

78. Select the best description for the term “linear scale".
    a) A linear scale has one hundred equal divisions each located next to a number.
    b) A linear scale has four equal quarters.
    c) A linear scale has ten large equal divisions each located next to a number.
    Answer: c
    线性刻度（linear scale）的特点是刻度划分均匀，通常有较大的等分刻度。

79. What is the term used to describe a meter scale which is very cramped on the high resistance end?
    a) Cramped
    b) Non-linear
    c) Small linear
    Answer: b
    高电阻端刻度非常拥挤的仪表刻度称为非线性（Non-linear）刻度。

80. What does the term "VOM" stand for in reference to a multimeter?
    a) Volts, ohms, milliamps
    b) Volts, oscillating, millivolts
    c) Volts, other, microamps
    Answer: a
    VOM 指的是伏特（Volts）、欧姆（ohms）和毫安（milliamps）。
