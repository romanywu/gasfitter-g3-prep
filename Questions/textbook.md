	Supervised:
	Unsupervised:
    Answer: The provided documents do not specify the exact certificates or licenses for servicing a process boiler with an input rate of 800,000 Btu/h (234 kW). It is generally implied that higher levels of certification or specialized certifications would be required for commercial or industrial applications beyond the scope of basic residential gas technician certificates.

	Unsupervised:
    Answer: The provided documents suggest that a Gas Technician 3 (G.3 certificate) may clean appliances under general supervision, or a Gas Technician 2 (G.2 certificate) or Gas technician 1 (G.1 certificate) may supervise this task.

    Answer: The documents state that a Gas Technician certificate holder (G.1, G.2, or DA) may disconnect and reconnect water piping to exchange, service, or install an approved appliance, provided they do not perform additional plumbing unless they hold a valid certificate of qualification as a plumber or steamfitter. Therefore, a G.1, G.2, or DA certificate holder could perform this under supervision if they are not a plumber/steamfitter, or unsupervised if they hold the appropriate plumbing/steamfitter certification.

A G.1 certificate is the highest level and covers work on natural gas and propane appliances of any BTU input. A G.2 certificate is limited to appliances with inputs of 400,000 Btuh or less. Therefore, for a 350,000 Btu/h appliance in a commercial building, a G.1 certificate would be required for unsupervised work, and potentially a G.2 under the supervision of a G.1.

246. Install an unvented residential gas appliance of 100 000 Btu/h (29 kW). name the certificates, licenses, or qualifications required to undertake the following activities.
